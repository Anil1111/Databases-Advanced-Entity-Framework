ABOUT THE COURSE
We will look in detail at working with a modern ORM technology: Entity Framework (EF), which is a standard ORM standard in C # and .NET applications. EF allows mapping between a relational base and object-oriented model using the "database first" and "code first" approaches and provides a powerful object-oriented API for querying the database and performing CRUD operations. We will demonstrate established practices in building a database layer on sophisticated systems using the "Repository" and "Unit of Work" templates.

During the course a practical team project will be developed that includes practical use of different DB servers (SQL Server, MySQL), data access platforms and technologies (ADO.NET, Entity Framework, etc.) and import and export to various formats for data (JSON, XML).

The course is part of the overall program with C # courses and tutorials for the "C # programmer" training at the University of Software.
